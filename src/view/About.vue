            Hello! I'm Sai Venkatesh, date when i saw light for the first time
            in 1994.I love creating things that are beautiful and functional.I
            am a Front End Developer / Creative Customizer with lots of passion
            towards Computer and Internet. As a UI engineer, I enjoy bridging
            the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my technical
            knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.
            My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and
            efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect
            user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably go for long
            rides with the friends in biker group.
